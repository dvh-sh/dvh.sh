          I'm a self-taught fullstack software engineer with over 7 years of
          experience. Currently, I'm balancing my software development work with
          full-time studies.

          Outside of coding, I enjoy hiking, photography, and horticulture. When
          I need to unwind, you'll often find me playing Tetris - it's my go-to
          game for relaxation.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the tech world, I have a particular interest in OSINT and some
          background in reverse engineering. I've also worked extensively with
          DevOps, streamlining development processes and improving efficiency.
        </p>
        <p>
          My past projects have involved low-level programming and optimization,
          particularly in areas that required innovative approaches to
          problem-solving. These experiences have honed my skills in creating
          efficient, high-performance solutions.

          Iâ€™m a self-taught full-stack software engineer with over seven years
          of experience. Currently, I juggle my software development
          responsibilities with full-time studies.

          Outside of coding, I find solace in hiking, photography, and
          horticulture. When I need to unwind, youâ€™ll often find me engrossed in
          playing Tetris - itâ€™s my go-to game for relaxation.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the tech world, I have a particular interest in Open Source
          Intelligence (OSINT) and some background in reverse engineering.
          Additionally, Iâ€™ve had extensive experience working with DevOps, where
          Iâ€™ve successfully streamlined development processes and enhanced
          efficiency.

          My past projects have involved low-level programming and optimization,
          particularly in areas that demanded innovative problem-solving
          approaches. These experiences have honed my skills in crafting
          efficient and high-performance solutions.
